# Title: "Richmond: Into the West"

## Page 1: "Jo"
The scorching desert wind howled through the barren landscape, kicking up dust as six men stood in the blistering sun, their silhouettes sharp against the horizon. They all wore wide-brimmed cowboy hats, the leather of their jackets creaking with every move. One man, his hat a shade lighter than the rest, stepped forward, standing slightly apart from the others. He had a smirk on his sunburnt face, his eyes narrowed with a blend of confidence and danger.

"Well, boys," he drawled in a thick western accent, his voice calm but carrying the weight of experience. "I reckon I could take down three of you before I even hit the dirt." With a smooth motion, he whipped out a gleaming Smith & Wesson Model 3, its barrel catching the sunlight as he leveled it at the group.

The other men hesitated, their fingers twitching near the holsters. One of them, a grizzled man in a faded red hat, stepped forward. His face was lined with confidence. "Feelin' mighty bold, ain't ya, Jo? After killin' Junior’s brother, Benjamin, like that?"

Jo, still smiling, shook his head. "It ain’t about bein’ bold, Stephen Henry. Benjamin left me no choice when he laid his filthy hands on Millie. But listen, this doesn’t have to end like this. Junior ain’t the man he used to be. You walk away now, and I’ll let this slide."

Stephen lit a cigar, puffing on it as the tension in the air thickened. He raised his hand, the gesture slow and deliberate. "Let ‘em rip, boys."

The air exploded with the crack of gunfire. Four men fired at once, bullets tearing through the space where Jo stood. But Jo’s eyes closed for just a moment, and in the next heartbeat, he squeezed the trigger. *Bang, bang, bang, bang.* Four shots, perfectly timed, cut through the chaos.

Silence descended as quickly as it had erupted. Jo opened his eyes, a cold grin spreading across his face. He holstered his smoking gun and surveyed the aftermath. "Well, would ya look at that," he said, reloading with a practiced ease, his revolver now aimed at Stephen's head. "Seems I took out four of you."

Stephen’s cigar slipped from his lips as he fell to his knees, his face pale with disbelief. Jo stepped closer, his voice low and calm. "Tell Junior Blackwell City ain’t Benjamin’s no more, it belongs to me now."

With that, Jo turned his back on the scene, his boots crunching in the dust as he walked off into the blazing sun, leaving Stephen alone in the silence of the dead desert.


## Page 2: "New Sheriff"
Jo’s boots stirred up the dust with every step as he walked away from the bodies. The town of Blackwell lay ahead, shimmering in the desert heat like a mirage. The sun had begun its slow descent, casting long shadows across the barren land, but the weight of the showdown lingered in the air behind him.

His mind wandered as he approached the town, replaying the events that led to this moment. Millie’s face flashed before his eyes—her wide-eyed fear when Benjamin had cornered her, the bruises he’d left on her pale skin after raping her. Jo clenched his jaw, pushing the memory aside. There was no room for regret in this life, no time to second-guess the choices he’d made. Blackwell needed a new sheriff, and he wasn’t about to let Junior’s boys ruin what was left of it.

As he neared the outskirts of Blackwell City, the familiar sights came into view—the rickety saloon with its peeling paint, the general store’s sun-bleached sign swinging in the breeze, and the church steeple standing tall, a lone sentinel over the dusty town.

The townsfolk were already gathering on the porches, eyes wide with curiosity and fear. Word traveled fast in the desert, faster than the wind that blew through it. They knew what Jo had done, and they knew what it meant. He was no longer just a wandering gunslinger; he was the man who had taken on Benjamin’s crew and come out alive.

Jo stopped in front of the saloon, his gaze sweeping over the faces of the onlookers. They stared back, waiting for his next move, their expressions a mix of hope and uncertainty.

With a deep breath, Jo pushed open the swinging doors of the saloon and stepped inside. The room fell silent as all eyes turned to him. Behind the bar, a grizzled old man with a gray beard and a stained apron looked up from his glass, his hands shaking ever so slightly.

"Jo Richmond," the old man greeted him, his voice raspy with age and hard years. "Heard you took care of some business out there."

Jo nodded, striding to the bar and setting his revolver down on the worn wood. "Business had to be done, Gus. Blackwell needs peace, and I’m gonna see that it gets it."

Gus studied him for a long moment before nodding slowly. "Ain’t nobody else left who could do it."

Jo leaned against the bar, his shoulders heavy with the weight of what was coming. "Junior will be comin’ soon. He won’t let this slide, he loved his brother."

Gus frowned, glancing nervously at the door. "You think you can take him?"

Jo didn’t answer right away. Instead, he poured himself a shot of whiskey, the amber liquid catching the dim light of the saloon. He downed it in one go, savoring the burn as it slid down his throat. Setting the glass down, he met Gus’s gaze.

"Don’t matter if I can take him or not," Jo said quietly. "What matters is that I stand up to him. This town’s been under Benjamin's thumb long enough. It’s time someone stood their ground."

Outside, the sun dipped lower on the horizon, casting the world in a blood-red hue. Jo turned his back to the bar, resting his hands on his revolver.

The calm before the storm was always the hardest part.

## Page 3: "Ghosts of the Past"

Jo set the empty whiskey glass down with a soft clink, the silence in the saloon thick as the dust outside. He turned to Gus, his voice low and steady. "You talk Samuel or Huston lately?"

Gus shook his head, the lines of his face deepening. "Not since the crew broke up five years ago. You know how it went down. After the Nicon fell apart, Junior cut all ties. We were the best damn crew out there—Gus Henderson, Jo Richmond, Junior Ashfield, Samuel Scott, and Huston Kristopher, we had out names out there... But when the pigs came lookin’ for who hit Kelkreek National Bank, Junior left us for dead."

Jo let out a bitter chuckle, shaking his head at the memory. Kelkreek was another world, another country across the border, a place they’d barely escaped with their lives. The score should’ve set them up for years, but it had torn them apart instead.

"Yeah," Jo said, a trace of nostalgia in his voice. "Those were the good times. We pulled off jobs no one else would touch, took risks nobody else dared. Got ourselves a hefty bounty doing it too, but Junior... he was always lookin' out for himself."

Gus nodded, his expression softening. "He ain’t the same man now, Jo. He built the Red Hats from the ashes of what we had, but there ain’t no loyalty in that gang. It’s all fear and control."

Jo poured himself another shot, then paused. His fingers tapped the glass lightly as if considering something far away. "I guess that’s what it’s come to now, huh? We were brothers once. Now we’re just ghosts of the past."

Gus gave a wry smile. "Ain’t that the truth."

Jo downed the shot in one gulp, letting the burn settle in his chest before setting the glass down hard on the bar. He tossed a few coins in Gus's direction, the metal clattering against the wood.

"Keep the change," Jo muttered, standing up and adjusting his hat. "I got a long night ahead of me."

Gus caught the coins in his palm, watching as Jo pushed through the swinging doors and stepped back into the fading sunlight.

The streets of Blackwell were empty, shadows creeping across the ground as night approached. Jo's boots crunched against the dirt, his steps a little unsteady from the whiskey. The weight of his revolver at his side was a constant reminder of what was to come.

As he made his way down the main street, his senses were heightened, even through the haze of alcohol. The silence of the town felt off. His eyes flicked to the corners of buildings, down narrow alleys, and toward the windows of the shuttered stores.

That’s when he saw them.

Two men lurking in the shadows, half-hidden behind the old general store. They weren’t doing a great job of keeping a low profile. The familiar red of their hats was unmistakable, marking them as members of Junior's new gang—the Red Hats.

Jo’s lips curled into a smirk, but his eyes remained cold. He kept walking, pretending not to notice, but his hand slowly drifted toward the grip of his revolver.

The streets of Blackwell might have been quiet tonight, but beneath that calm, a storm was brewing. And Jo was ready for whatever came next.

## Page 4: "A Father's Duty"

Jo kept his pace steady, his mind focused as he neared the outskirts of town. The Red Hats had trailed him all the way to his front door, but he wasn’t worried—they wouldn’t dare make a move on his turf. Not now. Not after what had just happened. He could feel their eyes on him as he reached for the door handle, but he didn’t look back. He knew the score; they were there to report back, not to engage.

With a final glance over his shoulder, Jo stepped inside his home, shutting the door softly behind him. The familiar scent of worn leather and old wood filled his nostrils, a comforting reminder of the life he had built for himself and Millie. 

He sighed heavily, leaning against the door for a moment. The house was quiet, too quiet, save for the faint creaking of floorboards as the wind rattled the windows. He didn’t bother turning on the light; he knew the way by heart. He walked down the narrow hallway, his boots thudding softly against the floor.

When he reached Millie’s room, he paused, hand hovering over the doorknob. Taking a deep breath, he pushed the door open.

The sight that greeted him twisted his heart. Millie lay in bed, her pale face drawn with pain, her dark hair splayed across the pillow. Her once bright eyes were dull, burdened by the weight of what had happened. She tried to sit up when she saw him, but a sharp wince stopped her, forcing her back down onto the bed.

“Millie,” Jo breathed, rushing to her side. He sat on the edge of the bed, taking her hand gently in his. “You shouldn’t be gettin’ up.”

“I wanted to greet you,” Millie whispered, her voice barely audible. Her lips trembled as she forced a weak smile, trying to reassure him. “Papa, are you... okay?”

Jo’s expression hardened as he nodded. “I took care of Benjamin,” he said, his voice rough with the memory of what he had done. “For what he did to you... he won’t ever hurt you again.”

Millie’s eyes widened in fear, and she gripped his hand tighter. “Papa, no! I don’t want you gettin’ back into that life for me. Please, you promised you’d stay out of it.”

Jo’s jaw clenched, his free hand resting on the bed beside her. “It’s a small price to pay for your honor, Millie. I’d do it again if I had to. Ain’t nothin’ more important to me than keepin’ you safe.”

A tear slid down Millie’s cheek, and she reached under her pillow, pulling out a folded letter. “Then, please, Papa... take this. It came while you were gone.”

Jo took the letter, his brows furrowing as he examined it. The seal on the back was all to familiar, and the name "Kelkreek" sent a shiver down his spine. With careful hands, he broke the seal and unfolded the paper, scanning the words quickly.

His heart skipped a beat.

The letter was from Huston, an old friend from the Nicon days, who had changed his identity after they went their separate ways. Huston wrote that he had started a new life in Dethokine, far from the reaches of their past. But what caught Jo off guard was the news that Huston had found Junior.

Jo’s eyes widened as he read on. According to Huston, Junior had somehow become the president of Kelkreek, a position that gave him power far beyond what Jo had imagined.

He swallowed hard, the paper trembling in his hands. Millie watched him closely, her concern deepening as she saw the shock in his eyes.

“I’m sorry, Millie,” Jo whispered, his voice breaking. He rose from the bed, the letter still clutched in his fist. “I have to go. I need to show this to Gus. He’ll come to protect you while I'm gone.”

“Papa, wait—” Millie tried to stop him, but the pain flared in her side, forcing her to stay put.

Jo glanced back at her, his eyes filled with a mix of guilt and determination. “I’ll be back soon. Stay here, rest. I’ll handle this.”

Without another word, Jo turned and hurried out of the room, the letter burning a hole in his pocket. As he ran out of the house, the cool night air hit him like a splash of water, clearing his mind. He needed to get to Dethokine, and fast. The stakes had just gotten a lot higher, and there was no telling what Junior’s next move would be.

The night was quiet, save for the rapid thud of Jo’s boots on the dirt road. He barely noticed the Red Hats retreating into the shadows as he sped past them. They could wait. Right now, he had bigger problems to deal with.

## Page 5: "Bad News Travels Fast"

Gus sat at the bar, wiping a glass absentmindedly with a rag that had seen better days. The saloon was quiet, the usual rowdy patrons long gone, leaving only the creak of the wooden floorboards and the faint whistle of wind outside to keep him company. His thoughts wandered to the past, to the days when he and Jo rode together, young and invincible, before the weight of years and betrayals had settled on their shoulders like a heavy cloak.

The door to the saloon swung open with a groan, snapping Gus out of his reverie. A thin figure stood silhouetted in the doorway, backlit by the dying light of the setting sun. As the figure stepped inside, Gus squinted, recognizing the familiar lanky form of Timothy, the town's courier.

Timothy was a boy barely into his teens, all legs and nerves, his wide eyes darting around the room as if expecting danger to leap out of the shadows. He had a letter clutched tightly in his hand, the paper crumpled and damp with sweat.

"Gus!" Timothy’s voice trembled as he hurried to the bar, nearly tripping over his own feet in his haste. "Gus, it’s important! Jo—he said I should give this to you right away!"

Gus frowned, his heart skipping a beat at the mention of Jo. He quickly set the glass down, reaching out to take the letter from Timothy’s shaking hand. The boy looked pale, his breath coming in short gasps, as if he’d run all the way from Jo’s house.

"What is it, son?" Gus asked, trying to keep his voice steady as he unfolded the letter. His hands were calloused, and the paper felt fragile between his fingers, almost like it would crumble if he wasn’t careful.

Timothy swallowed hard, his eyes darting to the door as if he wanted to bolt. "Jo said... Jo said to tell you that he’s leavin'. Said he got some news that... that Junior’s back in the picture. He didn’t say much more, just told me to give you this and... and tell you to watch over Millie."

Gus’s heart sank as he read the letter, Jo's hurried scrawl betraying the urgency and fear that had driven him to write it. The mention of Junior being in Kelkreek, with the kind of power the letter hinted at, was enough to send a chill down Gus’s spine. He knew Jo would never run from a fight, but this... this was different. Junior wasn’t just some outlaw anymore; he had the kind of authority that could wipe Blackwell off the map if he wanted to.

Gus set the letter down, his mind racing. Jo was walking straight into the lion’s den, and Gus couldn’t help but feel a heavy sense of foreboding. He knew the bond between them had frayed over the years, but they were still brothers in arms, bound by the blood they’d spilled and the lives they’d taken together.

"Thank you, Timothy," Gus said, his voice rough with emotion. He dug into his pocket, pulling out a silver coin and pressing it into the boy's hand. "You did good, son. Now go on home, and stay there. Things might get rough around here soon."

Timothy nodded, his eyes wide with fear, and clutched the coin tightly before bolting out the door, his footsteps echoing down the empty street.

Gus watched him go, a heavy sigh escaping his lips as he turned back to the letter. He knew what he had to do. Millie was alone, vulnerable, and with Jo gone, it was only a matter of time before Junior’s men came sniffing around. Gus couldn’t let that happen.

He tossed the rag onto the bar and grabbed his old shotgun from beneath the counter. The metal was cold in his hands, the weight of it a familiar comfort as he slung it over his shoulder. He hadn’t fired it in years, but he knew the feel of it as if no time had passed. His bones might be old, but his resolve was iron.

With one last look around the empty saloon, Gus stepped out into the gathering night. The town was eerily quiet, the kind of silence that only came before a storm. He headed toward Jo’s house, the weight of what was to come pressing down on him with every step.

As Gus approached the house, he spotted the faint glow of a lantern in Millie’s window. The sight of it brought a lump to his throat. He knew Jo would never forgive himself if something happened to her, and that was a burden Gus wasn’t about to let his old friend carry.

He reached the front door and knocked softly, the sound echoing in the stillness. After a moment, the door creaked open, and Millie’s pale face appeared, her eyes wide with worry.

"Gus," she whispered, her voice trembling. "Is Papa... is he gone?"

Gus nodded, his expression grave. "Yeah, Millie. He had to leave. But don’t you worry none. I’m here to make sure you’re safe. Ain’t nobody gonna hurt you while I’m around, you hear?"

Millie nodded, tears welling in her eyes as she stepped aside to let him in. Gus walked into the house, the weight of his promise settling on his shoulders like a yoke. He knew what was coming, and he knew it wouldn’t be easy.

But he’d be damned if he let Junior’s shadow darken Blackwell any more than it already had.

## Page 6: "The Long Ride to Kelkreek"

Jo’s horse galloped beneath him, hooves pounding the earth in a relentless rhythm. The landscape blurred into a monotonous smear of greens and browns as he pushed on, day and night, through rain and wind, without rest. Five days passed, and still, the country of Kelkreek lay far beyond the horizon. The journey was proving longer than Jo had expected, and despite the weariness gnawing at his bones, he urged his horse onward.

The sun had begun its descent on the fifth day, casting long shadows across the rugged terrain as Jo finally slowed his pace. His horse was panting, its sides heaving with exhaustion. They were still only a quarter of the way to Kelkreek, and Jo knew he needed to rest—if not for himself, then for the animal beneath him.

As the lights of a small town came into view, Jo guided his horse off the main road and toward the cluster of buildings. It was the town of Dethokine, based in Yorkshire, the same country Blackwell was in, it was quiet this time of year, the streets nearly empty as the townsfolk retreated indoors to escape the biting evening chill. The town, though modest, had the familiar look of countless others Jo had passed through in his years on the run—dusty, weary, with a single saloon offering the only reprieve from the loneliness of the frontier.

Jo dismounted, his legs stiff from the long ride, and tied his horse to the hitching post outside the saloon. He patted the animal’s neck, whispering soft words of gratitude before turning toward the creaky wooden doors. They swung open with a soft groan as Jo stepped inside, the warmth of the fire and the smell of cheap whiskey washing over him.

The saloon was dimly lit, with a handful of patrons nursing drinks at the bar or slumped over tables, lost in their own troubles. Jo made his way to the bar, his boots thudding softly against the worn floorboards. He dropped onto a stool, his muscles protesting the movement after days in the saddle.

The barkeep, a grizzled man with a thick beard and a permanent scowl, approached him, wiping a glass with a stained rag. Jo leaned forward, his voice low and rough from the journey. "Bourbon."

The barkeep’s eyes narrowed as he set the glass down, his gaze flicking over Jo’s dusty clothes and road-weary face. Without a word, he reached under the counter and pulled out a revolver, pointing it at Jo. The barkeep’s hand lingered on his gun, and he jerked his chin toward a board behind the counter.

Jo glanced up and felt his gut tighten. Bounty posters covered the board, each one depicting a familiar face—members of his old crew. And there, in the center, was his own likeness, the bounty stamped in bold letters: $500,000. Dead or Alive.

The barkeep leaned in, his voice a low growl. "We don’t serve Nicon here."

Jo’s hand tightened around his holster, but he kept his expression neutral. Before he could respond, a woman approached from the shadows, her perfume cutting through the stench of alcohol and sweat. She was pretty in a worn sort of way, her dress a little too tight, her smile a little too practiced. 

"Well, aren’t you a handsome one," she purred, sliding onto the stool next to Jo. Her hand brushed his arm, her eyes full of promise. "Five dollars, and I’ll make you forget all about your troubles."

Jo turned to look at her, his gaze cool and unyielding. "No thanks."

The woman’s smile faltered, her eyes narrowing with irritation. She stood up, smoothing her dress with a huff. "No manners, either," she muttered before sauntering off to try her luck elsewhere.

Jo let out a slow breath, then reached into his coat pocket, pulling out a worn twenty-dollar bill. He slid it across the bar, his eyes locking with the barkeep’s. "Seen any Red Hats around these parts?"

The barkeep hesitated, his gaze flicking to the money before he snatched it up and tucked it into his apron. He leaned closer, his voice barely above a whisper. "Saw them draggin’ off one of your kind two days ago. Headed north, toward the old mines. They weren’t in no hurry neither, like they knew no one’d come after ‘em."

Jo’s jaw clenched as he processed the information. He downed the bourbon in one swift motion, the burn of the alcohol grounding him as he considered his next move. The Red Hats were close, closer than he’d anticipated, and if they had a Nicon, it meant they were up to something bad.

"Thanks," Jo muttered, standing up and tossing a few more coins on the bar. The barkeep nodded, watching him with a wary eye as Jo headed for the door.

As he stepped back out into the cold night air, Jo paused, taking in the quiet of the town. He had no time to waste. If the Red Hats were holding one of his own, who he'd assumed was Huston, he’d have to get to them before it was too late. He untied his horse and swung back into the saddle, the weariness in his bones forgotten as he urged the animal forward, into the dark night, and toward whatever fate awaited him in Kelkreek.


## Page 7: "Samuel"
Jo moved through the dusty streets of Dethokine, pulling his hat low over his eyes as he asked around town about the Red Hats and the man they were dragging. The townsfolk were hesitant at first, offering little more than shrugs or nervous glances, but Jo’s persistence eventually paid off. A banker mentioned that he’d seen someone asking for work who might be tied to the Red Hats, and Jo’s heart skipped a beat when he recognized the description.

It had been a long time since Jo had seen Samuel, but the man’s unmistakable limp and distinct way of carrying himself gave him away. Jo couldn’t believe Samuel was in town. They hadn’t crossed paths in years, not since their days with the Nicon gang, but hearing that he was here—so close—sent a jolt of adrenaline through him. Following the lead, Jo made his way to the east side of town, where Samuel was reportedly staying.

The house was small, unassuming, with a weathered porch and fading paint. Jo approached cautiously, his hand hovering near the handle of his revolver, just in case. He knocked firmly on the door, the wood rattling slightly under his knuckles.

After a moment, the door creaked open, revealing a woman who appeared to be in her mid-thirties. She had sharp eyes that softened when she saw him, though there was a guarded quality behind her smile.

“Who are you?” she asked, her voice calm but curious.

Jo cleared his throat, tipping his hat slightly. “I’m a friend of Samuel’s. Name’s Jo. And you are?”

The woman studied him for a beat, then opened the door wider. “Come on in, then. I’m his wife, Sarah Scott.”

Jo blinked, surprised. Samuel never mentioned being married, not that Jo had been around for the last few years to hear such news. He stepped inside, following Sarah into a modest kitchen that smelled faintly of fresh bread and herbs. She motioned for him to sit at the table, which he did, feeling a bit out of place.

As she moved about the kitchen, Sarah asked, “So, how do you know Sammy?”

Jo chuckled, leaning back in his chair. “We used to run with the Nicon back in the day. Haven’t seen him in a long while.”

Sarah paused, her back turned to him, before turning around slowly, surprise flickering across her face. “The Nicon? Well, Sammy’s going to be pleased to see an old friend, that’s for sure.” She smiled warmly, but something about the way she said it made Jo’s instincts twitch.

“You want some tea while you wait?” she offered, already setting a kettle on the stove.

“Sure, tea sounds good,” Jo replied, trying to shake off the unease creeping into his chest. As Sarah fixed the tea, Jo glanced around the kitchen. It was quaint, homely, nothing like the rough-and-tumble places he’d seen Samuel in before. It didn’t seem like the kind of place a man like Samuel would settle down.

Sarah brought over a steaming cup of tea and placed it in front of him, taking a seat across the table. Jo took a sip, the warmth of the tea a welcome comfort after his long day of searching.

“So, Jo,” Sarah began, watching him closely, “what brings you to Dethokine? Looking for work?”

Jo took another sip of tea, feeling oddly tired all of a sudden. “You could say that. Heard about some trouble involving the Red Hats. You wouldn’t know anything about that, would you?”

Sarah’s smile didn’t falter, but there was a glint in her eyes that made Jo’s stomach churn. As they continued talking, Jo felt his eyelids growing heavier, his words slurring. He tried to focus, but the room was beginning to spin.

His vision blurred, and he could just make out Sarah standing up, moving towards the counter. He watched in a daze as she picked something up—a red cowboy hat—and placed it on the table in front of him.

“Sammy isn’t who he used to be,” she said softly, her voice echoing in Jo’s mind as everything went dark.

And then, there was nothing.
